### DeBERGMANNIZE YOURSELF!

This is a stupid tool that removes from phpunit the creator name.

Please help me to improve the algorithm.


## Usage


```bash
$ wget https://raw.github.com/liuggio/deBergmannizer/master/deBergmannize.sh
$ chmod +x deBergmannize.sh
# BE CAREFUL IS NOT REVERSIBLE!!
# run as root
$ ./deBergmannize.sh "IF THE TESTS FAIL, IS ONLY MY FAULT"
```


This script come without warranties, 
I love PhpUnit and I use it everyday.



##TODO

1. A patch with `diff` instead sed

2. A ReBergmanizzer (restore)

3. Conquer the world.
